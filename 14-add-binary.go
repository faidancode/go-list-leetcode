// The Manual Strategy

// Pointers: Initialize i at the end of string a and j at the end of string b.

// Carry: Use an integer carry initialized to 0.

// Loop: While there are characters left in a OR b, or if there is a remaining carry:
// - Add the bit from a (if i >= 0) to sum.
// - Add the bit from b (if j >= 0) to sum.
// - The new bit for the result is sum % 2.
// - The new carry is sum / 2.

// Reverse: Since we build the result from right to left, we need to reverse the final string.
